# Hangman

This project is based on the game hangman where players try and guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
My aim for this project is to learn how to properly structure a project in a professional way and to have fun along the way.

In milestone 3 I have created 2 functions, 1 to check if the letter meets the requirements and the other to check if the letter is in the hidden word.
